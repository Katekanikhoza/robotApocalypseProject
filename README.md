PROJECT NAME: ROBOT APOCALYPSE Project.

                  DESCRIPTION:
Building a REST API which will store information about the survivors and resources they own after the World has been taken over by Robots.

                  INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use Intelij IDE and DBeaver/PgAdmin (Postgres) to run the project.
2. It is adviceable to switch off, zscalar internet security when sending & getting responses from Chrome.
3. I have included SQL scripts to showcase how I created the database, database table and it's columns.
4. All the urls to send and receive responses are commented inside my controller. 
5. I struggled to make the create a location data type (longitude & latitude) as expected, therefore I resulted into Inputing he name of the location instead of coordinates.
